## Pros and cons of TDD

Test-driven development has several advantages. Firstly, code quality is improved as tests are written before the code itself, helping to identify issues early in the development process. This prevents mistakes from propagating and becoming a bigger issue. TDD also helps to create more modular code, since developers must consider how to structure their code to make it testable. 

In terms of cons, TDD can be time-consuming, especially in the initial stages of development for more complex features. Finally, in some cases, it may be difficult to write tests for certain types of code, such as UI implementation or code that interacts with external systems. In that case, TDD will be very difficult to implement and may not be worth the time commitment.
